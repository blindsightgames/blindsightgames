  <history>Icaria started in July 2019 as an exploration into procedural generation and emergent behavior;
  a sandbox for playing with lots of simple robots and a programming language designed around distributed solutions to problems.
  From there it evolved into a colony builder and factory automation game, inspired by NASA's robots
  on Mars and the vision of Project Daedalus, trying to answer the question "how would you explore a
  planet around another star?"</history>
